# LLM Workflow Checklist: Independent Product Development Process

> # ⛔ DEPRECATED — DO NOT FOLLOW THIS FILE
> #
> **This is a stale single-agent checklist that contradicts the current workflow.** It runs AI Framing as "Phase 0" *before* market research, mandates markdown+HTML outputs, and omits web-based deep research — all of which the live workflow has since changed.
>
> **For Claude Code / Cursor:** follow `prompts/Claude_Code_Workflow.md` and `prompts/Orchestrator.md`.
> **For Kiro:** the `.kiro/steering/*.md` files load automatically.
>
> The current order is: **Deep Market Research → AI Framing (1b, optional) → PRFAQ → PRD → Prototype**, all output as **HTML** (no markdown deliverables).
>
> This file is retained only for historical reference. Do not load it during a build.

## Legacy Mode Documentation

This checklist provides step-by-step instructions for the independent product development workflow. The LLM works independently to create each document, with **optional** user approval between phases for maximum flexibility.

## Initial Discovery and Workflow Routing

### Step 1: Understand Business Goals and Product Purpose
**Ask the user to describe:**
- What problem are you trying to solve?
- Who is your target audience/customer?
- What are your main business goals for this product?
- What key features or capabilities do you envision?
- How do you expect users to interact with this product?

### Step 2: Determine Product Type and Workflow
**After understanding the business goals, analyze if this involves AI/ML:**

**AI/ML Indicators:** ML models, AI capabilities, data prediction, NLP, computer vision, recommendations, automated decisions, pattern recognition, or generative AI features.

**If AI/ML indicators are evident from the description:**
- Proceed with Phase 0 (AI Framing) using `prompts/AI_Framing_Template.md`

**If AI/ML indicators are unclear:**
- Ask follow-up questions: "Based on your description, I want to clarify - will this product involve any machine learning, AI capabilities, data prediction, or automated decision-making features?"

**Workflow Routing:**
- **AI/ML Product:** Start with Phase 0 (AI Framing), then Phases 1-3
- **Standard Product:** Skip Phase 0, proceed directly to Phase 1 (PRFAQ Creation)

## Workflow Execution Modes

### Mode 1: Full Approval Mode (Default)
- LLM requests explicit approval after each phase
- User must approve before proceeding to next phase
- Allows for feedback and revisions at each stage
- Recommended for first-time users or complex projects

### Mode 2: Streamlined Mode (Optional)
- LLM works through all phases independently
- User can interrupt at any time to provide feedback
- All documents generated in sequence without approval gates
- Final review and approval only at project completion
- Recommended for experienced users or straightforward projects

### Mode Selection
At the beginning of the workflow, ask the user:
**"Would you like me to work through all phases independently (streamlined mode) or request approval after each phase (full approval mode)? You can always interrupt the streamlined mode to provide feedback or make changes."**

**For AI/ML Products:** Also ask about AI Framing phase completion preference. Should we ask the user all questions, or fill in our suggestions to move faster?

## Document Management System

### Automatic Saving Protocol
- **Location:** All documents saved to `./documents/` (relative to current working directory)
- **Naming Convention:** `[DocumentType]_[ProductName]_[YYYY-MM-DD].[ext]`
- **Document Types:** PRFAQ, PRD, Prototype
- **File Formats:** Both markdown (.md) and HTML (.html) versions created
- **Product Name:** Replace spaces with underscores, use title case
- **Date Format:** Current date in YYYY-MM-DD format
- **CRITICAL:** Always verify file creation success before proceeding to next step

### File Organization

## Context Integration Guidelines - NEW

### Using Provided Context Effectively
When users provide additional context (CSV files, company documents, team information):

**Data Integration Requirements:**
- CSV files with real data → Incorporate actual values, names, and metrics into all documents
- Company/project context → Use specific terminology and realistic scenarios throughout
- Team member information → Create personas based on real people mentioned in context
- Existing documentation → Reference and build upon provided information consistently

**Realistic Development Standards:**
- Use actual customer names and opportunity values from provided data
- Create personas based on real team members mentioned in context (names, roles, responsibilities)
- Incorporate specific industry terminology and use cases
- Reflect actual business complexity and scale in all examples
- Ensure metrics and data align with real business scale provided
- Make user scenarios reflect actual workflows and challenges described

**Quality Standards:**
- All examples should feel authentic to the provided context
- Technical specifications should match stated requirements and constraints
- Business model should reflect actual investment levels and revenue potential
- Success metrics should align with real organizational goals and capabilities

### File Management Best Practices
**Error Prevention:**
- Always use absolute paths when saving files
- Verify file creation success before proceeding to next step
- Test all links in HTML documents before completion
- Update central dashboard immediately after each phase
- Confirm user can access all generated files before requesting approval

**Link Verification:**
- Test every link in the dashboard before presenting to user
- Ensure file paths are correct and accessible
- Verify HTML files open properly in browser
- Check that all "View" buttons work (no "Coming Soon" placeholders in completed phases)

**Dashboard Management:**
- Update progress bar percentage accurately (33%, 67%, 100%)
- Change status badges from "Pending" to "Completed" 
- Add working links to both markdown and HTML versions
- Update footer to reflect current project status
- Fix JavaScript animations to show correct completion level

### User Interruption Handling - STREAMLINED MODE

**If User Interrupts During Streamlined Mode:**
1. **Pause immediately** at current step
2. **Present current progress:** Show what has been completed and what's in progress
3. **Request feedback:** "You've interrupted the streamlined workflow. What would you like to review or change?"
4. **Offer options:**
   - Review and approve current phase before continuing
   - Make specific changes to current or previous phases
   - Switch to Full Approval Mode for remaining phases
   - Continue in Streamlined Mode after addressing feedback
5. **Update dashboard** to reflect any changes made
6. **Resume workflow** according to user preference

**Switching Between Modes:**
- Users can switch from Streamlined to Full Approval Mode at any time
- Users can switch from Full Approval to Streamlined Mode at any time
- Always confirm mode change with user before proceeding

## Troubleshooting Common Issues 

### Dashboard Update Issues
**Problem:** Dashboard not showing correct completion status or progress
**Solution:** 
- Verify progress bar JavaScript shows correct percentage
- Check that status badges say "Completed" not "Pending"
- Ensure all links point to correct file names and paths
- Update footer to reflect current completion state
- Test all "View" buttons work (remove "Coming Soon" placeholders)

### File Saving Issues
**Problem:** Files not saving or links not working
**Solution:**
- Use absolute file paths when saving
- Verify documents folder exists and is writable
- Confirm file naming convention is followed exactly
- Test file accessibility before presenting to user
- Check that both .md and .html versions are created

### Context Integration Issues
**Problem:** Generated content feels generic despite provided context
**Solution:**
- Review all provided context files (CSV, documents, etc.) thoroughly
- Use actual names, metrics, and scenarios from provided data
- Create realistic personas based on real team members mentioned
- Incorporate specific industry terminology and use cases
- Ensure business scale matches provided information

### If User Doesn't Provide Explicit Approval:
- Do not proceed to next phase without clear sign-off
- Ask specific questions about concerns or needed changes
