# PRFAQ Guide

This steering file guides PRFAQ creation using Amazon's "Working Backwards" methodology. Include this when creating Press Release and FAQ documents.

## Challenge Check (run BEFORE writing)

Before writing the PRFAQ, critically examine research inputs:
1. Is the pain point actually severe enough to build a product around, or are we overweighting vocal minorities?
2. Are we cherry-picking research that confirms our hypothesis while ignoring disconfirming evidence?
3. What's the strongest argument that this market doesn't actually want a new solution?
4. Which competitor could ship this feature next quarter and make our product irrelevant?
5. Are the TAM/SAM numbers realistic or aspirational? What would make them collapse?

Your FAQ section MUST address the strongest counterarguments identified here. A PRFAQ with softball questions is a failed PRFAQ.

## Working Backwards Questions

Before writing, answer these 5 questions:

1. **Who is the customer and what insights do we have about them?**
2. **What is the prevailing customer problem/opportunity?**
3. **What is the solution? Why is it the right solution versus alternatives?**
4. **How would we describe the end-to-end customer experience?**
5. **How will we define and measure success?**

## Writing Guidelines

### Press Release Tone
- Written as if the product already exists
- Customer-focused, not feature-focused
- Clear, jargon-free language
- Specific and concrete
- Grounded in market reality
- Avoid excessive emojis unless essential to the product's tone (e.g., playful apps for younger audiences)

### FAQ Guidelines
- Questions customers would actually ask
- Address concerns and objections
- Provide substantive answers
- 5-10 questions covering:
  - Who/what/why
  - How it works
  - Pricing and availability
  - Getting started
  - Technical requirements (if applicable)

### For AI/ML Products
- Explain AI capabilities in customer terms
- Address trust and transparency concerns

- Competitive gaps into differentiation story
- Customer pain points into problem statement
- Pricing intelligence into FAQ
