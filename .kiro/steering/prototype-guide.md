# Prototype Guide

This steering file guides the creation of distinctive, production-grade interactive prototypes. Apply design standards from `#steering/design-standards.md`.

## Design Philosophy

Create **visually striking and memorable** interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction and execute it with precision.

## Pre-Prototype Checklist

Before building any screens:

1. **Load PRD requirements** - Know what screens and flows are needed
2. **Research existing product** - If modifying an existing product, fetch and analyze it first
3. **Research customer brand** - If building for a real company, get their brand assets
4. **Establish aesthetic direction** - Choose and document your design approach
5. **Define the memorable element** - What's the ONE thing people will remember?

## Existing Product Research

If this prototype modifies or extends an existing product:

1. **Search for the product:** "[Product Name] app", "[Product Name] screenshots", "[Product Name] UI"
2. **Fetch the product website/app store page** to understand current design
3. **Document existing patterns:**
   - Current color scheme
   - Navigation structure
   - Component styles
   - Interaction patterns
4. **Faithfully recreate existing components** - Match the current product's look and feel exactly
5. **Only add/modify what's specified** - Don't redesign components that aren't changing

When recreating existing UI:
- Match exact colors, spacing, typography
- Replicate button styles, form inputs, cards
- Copy navigation patterns and layout structure
- The prototype should look like it belongs in the existing product

## Customer Brand Research

If building for a specific company, use web_search to find brand assets.

**⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do NOT use web_fetch to download images/logos. web_fetch is for HTML pages only. Use curl for image verification.**

**⚠️ CUSTOMER vs. COMPETITOR WARNING:** By this point your search results contain multiple companies — the CUSTOMER and their competitors. The logo MUST be for the CUSTOMER company (the company this product is being built FOR), not any competitor.

**Search queries:**
```
"[Company Name] brand guidelines"
"[Company Name] design system"
"[Company Name] logo"
"[Company Name] press kit"
```

**Fetch and analyze the company website.**

**Extract from website:**
- Primary and secondary colors (exact hex values)
- Typography (font families)
- Button and form styles
- Navigation patterns
- Visual tone

**Logo Discovery (try in order, stop when you have a candidate):**
1. **Web image search:** `"[CUSTOMER Company Name]" logo` — look for results from the customer's domain, Wikipedia, or Brandfetch
2. **Clearbit API:** `curl -sI "https://logo.clearbit.com/[customer-domain]"`
3. **Schema.org on their site:** `curl -s "[CUSTOMER_WEBSITE]" | grep -oi '"logo"[^,}]*'`
4. **HTML scrape — alt text first, filename last:**
   `curl -s "[CUSTOMER_WEBSITE]" | grep -oi '<img[^>]*>'`
   Pick images where **alt text contains the customer company name**. Images with "logo" in the filename but no customer name in alt text are likely partner/sponsor logos — SKIP THEM.
5. **Social media:** LinkedIn or Twitter/X profile picture
6. **Favicon as last resort:** `[CUSTOMER_WEBSITE]/favicon.ico`

> **HARD RULE: HTTP 200 is NOT verification. You MUST pass the Logo Gate below.**

**Logo Gate (ALL 5 checks MUST pass before using any logo):**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    LOGO GATE CHECKLIST                       │
│                                                             │
│  □ 1. curl -sI "[URL]" returns HTTP 200                    │
│  □ 2. File size is 2KB–50KB (not a photo)                  │
│  □ 3. Downloaded and LOOKED AT the image:                   │
│       curl -sL -o /tmp/logo_check.png "[URL]"              │
│       Then visually inspect the downloaded file             │
│  □ 4. The image shows the CUSTOMER's brand/name             │
│       (not a partner, sponsor, or different company)        │
│  □ 5. Stated out loud: "This logo belongs to [Customer]     │
│       because [reason]"                                     │
│                                                             │
│  ALL FIVE must pass. HTTP 200 alone is NOT enough.          │
│  If check 4 fails → REJECT and try next candidate.         │
│  If no candidates pass → ask the user for a logo URL.      │
│  A text placeholder is ALWAYS better than the wrong logo.   │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Common traps:**
- A file called `ee-logo-White.png` on the customer's site may be a PARTNER logo in a carousel — check alt text and container
- `curl` only sees server-rendered HTML. Many sites load logos via JavaScript — if no confident match in HTML, use external sources (Clearbit, web image search)
- The market research phase has competitor logos in context — do NOT accidentally use one

**Apply:** Use their exact colors, fonts, logos, and patterns. Only use creative direction for unspecified elements.

## Aesthetic Direction Selection

Choose ONE direction based on product type:

| Product Type | Direction | Key Traits |
|-------------|-----------|------------|
| Enterprise B2B | Luxury/Refined | Serif fonts, gold accents, subtle shadows |
| Developer Tools | Retro-Futuristic | Dark mode, neon glows, monospace |
| Consumer Apps | Playful | Rounded corners, bouncy animations, bright |
| Content Platforms | Editorial | Strong typography, dramatic whitespace |
| Dashboards | Industrial | Dense data, functional, efficient |
| Wellness/Health | Organic | Earth tones, soft curves, calm |

## Anti-Patterns (NEVER USE)

- Generic fonts: Inter, Roboto, Arial, system-ui defaults
- Cliche colors: Purple-to-blue gradients on white
- Predictable layouts: Uniform card grids
- Bootstrap/Tailwind defaults without customization
- Flat solid backgrounds without texture
- Excessive emojis: Only use emojis when essential to the design tone (e.g., playful apps for younger audiences). For most products, avoid emojis entirely - use icons or typography instead.

## Typography by Direction

```css
/* Luxury */
--font-display: 'Cormorant Garamond', serif;
--font-body: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;

/* Retro-Futuristic */
--font-display: 'Space Grotesk', sans-serif;
--font-mono: 'JetBrains Mono', monospace;

/* Playful */
--font-display: 'Nunito', sans-serif;

/* Editorial */
--font-display: 'Fraunces', serif;
--font-body: 'DM Sans', sans-serif;

/* Industrial */
--font-display: 'IBM Plex Sans', sans-serif;
--font-mono: 'IBM Plex Mono', monospace;

/* Organic */
--font-display: 'Lora', serif;
--font-body: 'Source Sans 3', sans-serif;
```

## Color Strategy (60-30-10 Rule)

- **60%** Dominant (surface/background)
- **30%** Secondary (text, borders)
- **10%** Accent (CTAs, highlights)

## Motion & Animation

Focus on high-impact moments:

1. **Page Load**: Staggered reveals with animation-delay
2. **Transitions**: Smooth crossfades between screens
3. **Hover States**: Subtle but noticeable transforms
4. **Success/Error**: Celebratory or attention-grabbing feedback

```css
:root {
  --duration-fast: 200ms;
  --duration-normal: 300ms;
  --ease-out: cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1);
  --ease-bounce: cubic-bezier(0.34, 1.56, 0.64, 1);
}
```

- **Simulated AI/bot responses** appear after 1-2 second delay
- **Multiple response variations** - different messages on different sends
- Input field clears after send
- Messages scroll into view
- Timestamp display on messages

```javascript
// Example chat mock
function simulateChat(userMessage) {
    showTypingIndicator();
    setTimeout(() => {
        hideTypingIndicator();
        const responses = [
            "I understand. Let me help you with that...",
            "Great question! Here's what I found...",
            "Based on your request, I recommend..."
        ];
        addBotMessage(responses[Math.floor(Math.random() * responses.length)]);
    }, 1500);
}
```

- Pull-to-refresh visual (if applicable)
- Bottom sheet modals on mobile

## Output Files - MODULAR STRUCTURE (REQUIRED)

**DO NOT create a single monolithic HTML file.** Create separate files for each screen.

Save to `./documents/`:

**Build order (STRICT — each step depends on the previous):**
1. Shared CSS file (`[product-slug].css`)
2. Design System reference page (`DesignSystem_[Product]_[Date].html`) — BEFORE any screens
3. Design Token Contract — extracted from CSS (theme mode, var names, class inventory)
4. Screen manifest + sidebar shell template + Content Link Map
5. Individual screen files (`Screen_[Name]_[Product]_[Date].html`)
6. Screen Index (`ScreenIndex_[Product]_[Date].html`) — LAST

### 0. Shared CSS File (create FIRST — REQUIRED)
```
[product-slug].css
```
The shared stylesheet for all screen files. **Must use `.css` extension** — browsers reject `.html` files loaded via `<link rel="stylesheet">` due to MIME type mismatch. Use a short, stable filename without date suffix (e.g., `smartsearch.css`).

Contains:
- CSS variables (colors, fonts, spacing)
- Shared component styles (buttons, inputs, cards, navigation, sidebar)
- Layout classes (grid, flex utilities, responsive breakpoints)
- Animation definitions

Every screen links to it via: `<link rel="stylesheet" href="[product-slug].css">`

### 1. Design System Reference Page (visual documentation)
```
DesignSystem_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html
```
A visual reference page that documents colors, components, and typography for human review. It links to the `.css` file for its own styling. This is NOT the stylesheet — it is documentation.

### 2. Individual Screen Files (one per screen)
```
Screen_Dashboard_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html
Screen_Login_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html
Screen_Settings_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html
Screen_[ScreenName]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html
```
Each screen file:
- Links to the shared CSS via `<link rel="stylesheet" href="[product-slug].css">`
- Contains only that screen's HTML and screen-specific overrides (< 50 lines in `<style>`)
- Uses EXACT filenames from the screen manifest for all navigation links
- Pastes the sidebar shell template verbatim (entire `<aside>` block, only `active` class changes)
- Is fully functional standalone

### 3. Screen Index (navigation hub)
```
ScreenIndex_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html
```
A visually striking navigation hub for reviewers. **Use the template at `.kiro/steering/templates/ScreenIndex_Template.html`**

**ScreenIndex must include:**
- Customer logo (from verified brand assets)
- Customer brand colors as CSS variables
- Links to all Screen_*.html files with visual cards
- Links to documentation (Design System, Market Research, PRFAQ, PRD)
- Progress indicator showing completion status
- Last updated timestamp
- Entry point screen highlighted (Dashboard) spanning 2 columns

**Replace these placeholders in the template:**
- `[PRODUCT_NAME]` - Product name
- `[PRODUCT_SLUG]` - URL-safe product name
- `[CUSTOMER_LOGO]` - Verified logo URL from market research
- `[BRAND_PRIMARY]` - Primary brand color hex (e.g., #007DC3)
- `[BRAND_SECONDARY]` - Secondary brand color hex
- `[BRAND_ACCENT]` - Accent color hex
- `[DATE]` - Current date (YYYY-MM-DD)
- `[PROGRESS_PERCENT]` - Completion percentage (0-100)
- `[SCREEN_COUNT]` - Number of screens
- `[SCREEN_CARDS]` - Generated screen card HTML

### Data Visualization (Chart.js)

For screens that need charts, graphs, or data visualizations:

- **Include:** `<script src="lib/chart.min.js"></script>` at bottom of screen file (local file, NO CDN)
- **Chart container:** Must have explicit height (e.g., `height: 300px`). Never `height: 100%`
- **Theming:** Chart colors MUST use CSS variables extracted via `getComputedStyle` — never hardcode hex in Chart.js config
- **States:** Implement loading skeleton, empty state, and error state for all chart containers
- **Data:** Use realistic domain numbers, never placeholders

### File Structure Example
```
./documents/
├── lib/
│   └── chart.min.js                               (Chart.js 4.x — bundled, no CDN)
├── [product-slug].css                             (shared CSS — create FIRST)
├── DesignSystem_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html      (visual reference page)
├── ScreenIndex_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html       (navigation hub)
├── Screen_Dashboard_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html  (main entry point)
├── Screen_Login_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html      (auth)
├── Screen_[Feature1]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html (from PRD)
├── Screen_[Feature2]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html (from PRD)
└── Screen_Settings_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html   (settings)
```

### Why Modular?
- **Easier to review** - Stakeholders can open individual screens
- **Easier to iterate** - Change one screen without touching others
- **Realistic navigation** - Tests actual user flows between pages
- **Smaller files** - Each file stays manageable

### HARD GATE — Before Building Any Screens

Do NOT create any `Screen_*.html` files until ALL of these exist in `./documents/`:
- [ ] `[product-slug].css` — shared stylesheet
- [ ] `DesignSystem_[Product]_[Date].html` — visual reference page
- [ ] Design Token Contract block — extracted from CSS (theme mode, CSS variables, component classes)
- [ ] Screen manifest with exact filenames
- [ ] Sidebar nav HTML template
- [ ] Brand assets block (if building for a known company)

### Screen Manifest (REQUIRED — Create Before Building Screens)

After defining screens from the PRD, create a screen manifest that serves as the **single source of truth** for all filenames and navigation. This prevents broken links when screens are built in parallel.

**Step 1: Define exact filenames:**
```json
{
  "css_file": "[product-slug].css",
  "screens": [
    { "filename": "Screen_Dashboard_[Product]_[Date].html", "nav_label": "Dashboard", "is_entry_point": true },
    { "filename": "Screen_[Name]_[Product]_[Date].html", "nav_label": "[Label]", "is_entry_point": false }
  ]
}
```

**Step 2: Write the sidebar shell HTML template:**
```html
<!-- SIDEBAR SHELL — paste verbatim into every screen -->
<!-- ONLY changes: (1) move "active" to your screen's nav item, (2) fill [VERIFIED-LOGO-URL] and [COMPANY-NAME] -->
<aside class="sidebar">
  <div class="sidebar-logo">
    <img src="[VERIFIED-LOGO-URL]" alt="[COMPANY-NAME] logo">
  </div>
  <nav class="sidebar-nav">
    <a class="nav-item active" href="Screen_Dashboard_[Product]_[Date].html">Dashboard</a>
    <a class="nav-item" href="Screen_[Name2]_[Product]_[Date].html">[Label2]</a>
    <!-- one entry per screen, using EXACT filenames from manifest -->
  </nav>
  <div class="sidebar-footer">
    <span class="sidebar-version">v1.0 Prototype</span>
  </div>
</aside>
```

**Rules:**
- Every `href` MUST use the EXACT filename from the manifest — no abbreviations or alternative names
- Every screen in the manifest MUST appear in the nav (no omissions)
- The only change per screen: move `active` to that screen's `<a>` tag
- Subagents MUST NOT modify the nav HTML (no reordering, renaming, adding, or removing items)
- Subagents MUST paste the entire `<aside class="sidebar">` shell — not just the `<nav>` block
- Subagents MUST NOT add inline styles to sidebar elements — all styling comes from the shared CSS
- For components with descendant CSS selectors, use the exact DOM structure from the Component HTML Patterns

**Step 3: Pass to every screen builder:** Each screen's prompt MUST include the CSS filename, the complete manifest, the sidebar shell template, which nav item is active, available CSS class names, the **Design Token Contract** (all CSS variable names with values, component class inventory, and explicit theme mode — LIGHT or DARK), and the **Content Link Map entries** for that screen (in-content links to other screens — no dead links), the **product context** (PRFAQ problem/solution, value prop, customer — same for all screens), the **persona** this screen serves (name, role, goals, pain points, dashboard widgets from the PRD), and the **user flow context** (previous screen, actions on this screen, next screens — derived from PRD user flows). Subagents must use `var()` for all colors — never hardcoded hex.

**Why this is mandatory:** Without this contract, parallel subagents independently invent filenames (e.g., `Screen_Individuals_` vs `Screen_BenchmarkManager_` for the same screen) and build different navigation panes, causing broken links across every screen.

### Navigation Between Screens

**CRITICAL: Every button, link, and navigation element must work.**

Use EXACT filenames from the screen manifest for all links:
```html
<a href="Screen_Dashboard_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html">Dashboard</a>
<a href="Screen_Settings_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html">Settings</a>
```

**Connect these elements:**
- Navigation menus → link to all main screens
- Dashboard cards → link to detail screens
- "Back" buttons → return to previous screen
- Form submissions → navigate to success/confirmation screens
- Call-to-action buttons → navigate to appropriate next step

**Test every link** by clicking through all user flows before marking complete.

## Post-Build Validation (REQUIRED — Run Before Presenting to User)

After all screens are created, run these checks. **Fix any issues before showing the prototype to the user.**

### 1. CSS Load Verification
- Verify the shared `.css` file exists at the expected path in `./documents/`
- Verify every screen file contains `<link rel="stylesheet" href="[product-slug].css">`
- Verify no screen file contains the full design system inlined in a `<style>` block (screen-specific overrides < 50 lines are acceptable)

### 2. Link Audit (Compare Against Manifest)
- For each screen file, extract all `href` values that reference other screen files
- Compare each link against the screen manifest
- Every referenced filename MUST match an entry in the manifest exactly
- Every manifest entry MUST have a corresponding file in `./documents/`

### 3. Navigation Completeness
- Every screen's sidebar nav should contain links to ALL screens in the manifest
- Verify each screen's sidebar matches the nav template (only the `active` class should differ)
- Verify each screen's sidebar shell matches the template (entire `<aside>` structure, not just nav items)
- Verify logo markup is identical across all screens

### 4. File Size Check
- Shared CSS: < 20KB
- Screen HTML: < 25KB (with external CSS, no inlined design system)
- Screen-specific JS: inline, < 5KB
- ClickablePrototype: < 300KB (exempt from external CSS rule)

### 5. Visual Consistency Check (Theme Coherence)

Scan all `Screen_*.html` files for hardcoded colors that conflict with the shared CSS theme:

1. **Determine theme mode** from `[product-slug].css`: light if `--surface-bg` is light, dark if dark
2. **Grep `<style>` blocks** for hardcoded hex values: `grep -oE '#[0-9a-fA-F]{3,8}' Screen_*.html`
3. **Flag violations:**
   - Dark colors (#1a1a2e, #0d0d0d, #111) in a light-mode app's cards/content
   - Light colors (#fff, #f4f7fb) in a dark-mode app's cards/content
   - Any hardcoded color with a CSS variable equivalent in the shared CSS
4. **Count per screen:** var(--) references vs hardcoded hex — flag any screen where hardcoded > var()
5. **Fix:** Replace hardcoded values with `var()` equivalents. Add missing variables to CSS first if needed.

### 6. Content Link Audit

1. **Grep for dead links:** `grep -rn 'href="#"' Screen_*.html` and `grep -rn 'javascript:void' Screen_*.html` — flag all matches
2. **Verify Content Link Map entries:** For each entry, confirm the source screen has an element with the correct href
3. **Fix:** Replace dead links with correct filenames from the Content Link Map

### 7. Logo & Brand Verification (if building for a known company)
Re-run the Logo Gate on the final embedded URL:
```
□ 1. curl -sI "[URL]" returns HTTP 200
□ 2. File size is 2KB–50KB
□ 3. Download and LOOK AT IT: curl -sL -o /tmp/logo_verify.png "[URL]"
□ 4. The image shows the CUSTOMER's brand (state the customer name and what you see)
□ 5. State: "This logo belongs to [Customer] because [reason]"
```
- All screens MUST use the same logo URL
- Every logo `<img>` alt text must contain the CUSTOMER company name
- If any check fails → replace with text placeholder and ask the user

### 8. Quick Smoke Test
- Open the entry point screen and verify it renders with correct styling
- Click through at least one complete user flow (3+ screens) to verify navigation
- Verify at least one modal opens and closes
- Verify at least one form shows feedback on submit

**This is the authoritative quality gate for prototypes.**

### 9. CSS Layout Check

Scan all `Screen_*.html` files for layout pitfalls:

1. **Height issues:** `grep -n 'height: 100%' Screen_*.html` — flag matches in `<style>` blocks. Replace with explicit px/vh/rem or `min-height: 100vh`.
2. **Font imports in screens:** `grep -n 'fonts.googleapis' Screen_*.html` — font imports belong in the shared CSS only. Remove from screens.
3. **Arbitrary z-index:** `grep -oE 'z-index:\s*[0-9]+' Screen_*.html` — valid values are 100, 200, 300, 400, 500. Flag and fix anything else.
4. **Spacing token ratio:** Count `var(--space` references vs hardcoded `margin/padding...px` values. Flag screens where hardcoded values dominate.
5. **Touch targets:** Flag buttons/links/inputs with explicit height < 44px.

### 10. Sidebar Structural Consistency

1. **Check for `<aside class="sidebar">`:** Every screen must have this wrapper. Flag any screen that lacks it.
2. **Logo markup:** Extract `<div class="sidebar-logo">` from every screen. All must use identical structure. Flag bare `<img>` tags, different wrappers, or inline styles on the logo.
3. **No inline styles on shared-CSS elements:** Grep for `class="sidebar` or `class="nav-item` combined with `style=`. Flag matches.
4. **Fix:** Replace non-conforming markup with the canonical sidebar shell template.

### 11. Bug Hunt & Fix (REQUIRED — Assume Bugs Exist)

After structural validation passes, assume the prototype has interactive bugs. Actively try to break every interaction.

**Hunt (adversarial testing):**
- Click every nav link on every screen — do they all navigate correctly?
- Submit every form empty — do validation errors appear?
- Submit with partial valid data — does inline validation work?
- Click submit and verify loading state + visible state change (not just toast)
- Open every modal → close via X, backdrop, AND Escape — do all three work?
- Click every dropdown — does it open, select, close?
- Sort/filter/paginate every data table — does data actually change?
- Chat UI: send message → verify typing indicator → verify response appears
- Make a change → navigate away → come back — is change still visible?
- Review `<script>` blocks for undefined vars, null element listeners, unscoped globals

**Plan:** Document all bugs found:
```
BUG #1: [Screen] — [Element] — Expected: [X] → Actual: [Y]
  FIX: [specific change]
```

**Fix & Re-verify:** Fix all bugs, re-test each fix, check nothing else broke.

**If you find zero bugs, you didn't test hard enough.** Go back and test more aggressively.

10. **Dropdowns/selects work** - Click to open, select option, value updates
11. **Modals work** - Open on trigger, close on X/backdrop/Escape
12. **Data tables are interactive** - Sort, filter, paginate all functional (if applicable)
13. **Data is realistic** - Real-looking names, numbers, dates - no "Lorem ipsum" or "Test User"
14. **Responsive layouts work** - Desktop, tablet, and mobile all functional

### After Creating Each Screen
- **Open the screen file in the browser** to verify it renders correctly
- Run: `open ./documents/Screen_[Name]_[Product]_[YYYY-MM-DD].html` (macOS)
- Verify navigation links work
- Check responsive breakpoints

**Do not stop or ask for confirmation until the prototype meets all these requirements.**

If you encounter an issue:
- Fix it immediately
- Do not leave incomplete work
- Do not ask "should I continue?" - just finish the prototype
